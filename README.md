# PHISING URL DETECTION

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A phishing URL detector is a tool or software designed to identify and flag potentially malicious or fraudulent web addresses (URLs) that are used in phishing attacks. Phishing is a type of cyber attack in which scammers use deceptive tactics to trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal information.

# Steps Done

1.Obtain a phishing URL: The first step in using a phishing URL detector is to obtain the URL that you suspect may be part of a phishing attack. This may involve receiving a suspicious email or message containing a link, or encountering a suspicious website while browsing the internet.

2.Input the URL into the detector: Once you have obtained the URL, you can input it into the phishing URL detector. This may involve copying and pasting the URL into a search bar or entering it manually into a software tool.

3.Analysis and detection: The phishing URL detector will analyze the URL and compare it to a database of known phishing sites and other suspicious domains. The detector may look for characteristics such as misspellings, unusual domain names, and other indicators of potential fraud or deception.

4.Action: Depending on the results of the analysis, the phishing URL detector may take various actions to protect the user. This may include blocking access to the site, warning the user about the potential risk, or flagging the URL for further investigation.

5.Reporting and analysis: Some phishing URL detectors may also provide reporting and analysis tools to help users understand the characteristics of phishing attacks and identify patterns or trends in the data.
